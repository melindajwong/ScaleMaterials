# ScaleMaterials

This code runs this Shiny App: https://melindajwong.shinyapps.io/MinesDashboard/

Please feel free to download and add new pages/visualizations if needed. Data cleaning and regularization done previously is in the data_cleaning file under /scripts and the file named 'Mines Dashboard' does all of the visualizations, reactive inputs, etc. With any questions you can email vaq9qn@virginia.edu
